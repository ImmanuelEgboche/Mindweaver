# File Creation Assessment
### Task
As directed by Company Lockers Pvt. Ltd. I have created a prototype which  allows users to add, create, search and delete files of their choosing. This CLI application allows users to keep track of files they already have made whilst allowing them to create more. 

## Installation & usage
### Installation
- Clone or download the repo.
- Cd into project1 folder.
- In your command line, run `javac project1.java`.
- Then run `java project1`

### Usage
- Follow the instructions on the command line 
- 1 for creation, 2 for deletion, 3 for seacrhing and 0 to exit the application

## Technologies
- Java
- HashMaps for storing refernces to files
- File package for accessing file paths

## Process

![](process.png)
- Mapped out a skeleton using Excildraw as seen above
- Wrote pseudo code to break down the logic of collecting user input, accessing file paths, linking the two and assigning functionality to the CLI.

## Challenges
- Find the relative filepath on my virtual machine did produce some issues

## Future features
- This project would also provide functionality to edit files
- When file creation happens the user could choose the type of file they want to create rather than being locked into txt files.
