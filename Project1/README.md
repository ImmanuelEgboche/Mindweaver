![](process.png)
- Mapped out a skeleton using Excildraw as seen above
- Wrote pseudo code to break down the logic of collecting user input, accessing file paths, linking the two and assigning functionality to the CLI.

## Challenges
- Find the relative filepath on my virtual machine did produce some issues

## Future features
